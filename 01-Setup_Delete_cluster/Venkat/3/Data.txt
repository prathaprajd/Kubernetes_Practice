POD is the low level component in kubernetes.
POD is a wrapper which can contain multipl containers and volumes.

Normally we have use service to access pod.
But using kubectl port forward we can access pod without service.
Recommened to use kubectl port forward in develop not in production.
kubectl port forward can be used with pod,deployment and service.

kubectl port-forward pod/mongo-db-r3pl1ka3 8080 5762
kubectl port-forward deployment/mydeployment 8080 5762
kubectl port-forward service/myservice 8080 5762

without any service we can use kubeconfig file to test.(it may be a interview question).
One pod can not be shared with multiple nodes.

if u put yaml file in manifest,  pod will be created automatically without any API.
if u delete pod, pod will again create as file is in manifest folder.

replicationcontroller name changed to replicaset.

replicaset will run a loop at every second to check the number of replicas.

labels are most important in kubernetes and replicaset.
replicaset will not update image automatically. We have to delete the pod and create again then only image will be updated.


deployment create replicaset automatically.
deployment we are using in the time of deploying applications such as jave base application, python based applications.

kubectl rollout undo deployment myapp undo means going to previous state.

no maxunavailabe means 25%.

without api server we can install pod, this is called static pod
