mounting local path of a node is called hostpath.



using daemonSet we can run pod in each node at any condition.

In a volume we can create 1 PV, not multiple pv can create in a PV.

create pv and pvs automatically is called dynamic provisioning.

ebs is for only 1 AZ. For multiple AZ we have to use EFS.
